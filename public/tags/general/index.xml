      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to set up a website, a blog, and write.
Not that I had something to say online, I just wanted to blabber and share bits and pieces from time to time.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried out a few blogging platforms before but never stuck with them. They were too formal. I wanted a place where I can be informal. Just write and publish.
I liked HEY World, but it came only with their email service which was too expensive for me.</description>
